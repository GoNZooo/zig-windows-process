# zig-windows-process

This repo is meant to hold tools for tinkering with Windows processes
(though I might extend it in the future) to allow for a higher-level interface
for injecting DLLs and such.

The primary motivation is that I'd like to have a basic toolkit for dealing with
things that usually come up in game hacking and exploration.
